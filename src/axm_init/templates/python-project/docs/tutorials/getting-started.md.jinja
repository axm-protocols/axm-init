# Getting Started

This tutorial walks you through installing `{{ package_name }}` and running your first command.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip

## Installation

```bash
uv add {{ package_name }}
```

Or with pip:

```bash
pip install {{ package_name }}
```

## Step 1: Import and Use

```python
from {{ module_name }} import hello

print(hello())
# Output: Hello from {{ package_name }}!
```

## Step 2: Run the Tests

```bash
cd {{ package_name }}
make check
```

This runs lint + type check + security audit + tests.
